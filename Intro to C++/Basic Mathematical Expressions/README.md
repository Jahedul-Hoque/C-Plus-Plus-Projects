# 🧮 Basic Mathematical Expressions in C++

This project explores **fundamental mathematical operations** in C++, covering:  
✅ Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)  
✅ Incrementing & decrementing (`x++`, `++x`)  
✅ **BIDMAS (Operator Precedence)**  
✅ Using `const` for tax calculations  
✅ Handling user input (`cin`) for conversions 


## 🚀 Features  

## 🚀 Features Implemented  

### 🔢 1. Arithmetic Operations  
- **Addition (`+`)**  
- **Subtraction (`-`)**  
- **Multiplication (`*`)**  
- **Division (`/`)**  
- **Incrementing & Decrementing (`x++`, `++x`)**  

#### Example:  

int x = 10;
int y = x++; // y = 10, x becomes 11
int z = ++x; // x becomes 12, z = 12

### 🏗 2. Understanding BIDMAS (Operator Precedence)
double j = 1 + 2 * 3; // BIDMAS applies: j = 7
cout << "j is equal to " << j << endl;

### 💰 3. Business Tax Calculation
Given revenue: $95,000

State Tax: 4%

County Tax: 2%

Net Sales Calculation after tax

double sales = 95000;

double const StateTaxRate = 0.04;

double StateTax = sales * StateTaxRate;

double const CountyTaxRate = 0.02;

double CountyTax = sales * CountyTaxRate;

double TotalTax = StateTax + CountyTax;

sales = sales - TotalTax;

✅ Best Practice: Used const for tax rates to improve code clarity and maintainability.
