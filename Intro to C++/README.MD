## 📖 Overview
Welcome to my **C++ learning journey!** This repository contains various C++ projects that have helped me gain a deeper understanding of the language. Throughout these projects, I have explored key programming concepts such as **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **recursion**, **dynamic memory allocation**, **operator overloading**, and more.

## ✅ Completed Projects:
- 📌 [Pointers and References]
- 📌 [Trading Data & Price Calculation]
- 📌 [Recursion]
- 📌 [Object-Oriented Programming]
- 📌 [OOP with Inheritance]
- 📌 [Operator Overloading]
- 📌 [Dynamic Memory Allocation]

## ⏳ Upcoming Project:
- 🚧 **Data Structures and Algorithms** (In Progress)

5️⃣ Inheritance
=======
## 🔑 Key Topics Covered
Here are the C++ projects I have worked on, each demonstrating a specific concept:


### 📌 [Pointers and References]
- Understanding memory addresses and pointers.
- Using the reference (`&`) and dereference (`*`) operators.
- Working with null pointers and pointer arithmetic.

### 📌 [Trading Data & Price Calculation]
- Implementing **functions and arrays**.
- Using loops to process data dynamically.
- Performing calculations using **parameters and return values**.

### 📌 [Recursion]
- Implementing recursive functions.
- Understanding base and recursive cases.
- Real-world applications like factorial calculations.

### 📌 [Object-Oriented Programming]
- Creating **classes and objects**.
- Defining attributes and methods.
- Using constructors to initialize objects.

### 📌 [OOP with Inheritance]
- Understanding **inheritance** and how child classes inherit properties from a parent class.
- Overriding methods and extending class functionality.
- Creating objects from different inherited classes.

### 📌 [Operator Overloading]
- Customizing the behavior of **operators** (`+`, `-`, `==`).
- Implementing operator overloading in C++ classes.
- Encapsulation and modular code design.

### 📌 [Dynamic Memory Allocation]
- Using `new` and `delete` for **heap memory management**.
- Allocating memory dynamically for variables and arrays.
- Avoiding memory leaks and improving program efficiency.

## 🎯 Summary
Throughout this journey, I have developed a strong foundation in **C++ programming**, mastering core concepts and best practices. Each project showcases practical applications of C++ and its capabilities in **memory management, data structures, and object-oriented programming**.

This repository serves as a portfolio of my progress and a resource for anyone looking to learn C++! 🚀
