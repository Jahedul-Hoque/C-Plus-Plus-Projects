## 💰 **Financial & Trading Systems (Advanced Projects)**  

Here, I apply C++ to build **financial models**, optimize **market data processing**, and experiment with **low-latency trading strategies**.  

### ✅ Planned Projects:  

<progress value="0" max="3"></progress> **(0% Started)**

🔹 **Order Execution Engine** – Simulating trade execution with low-latency techniques ⏳  
🔹 **Backtesting System** – Running historical simulations for trading strategies ⏳  
🔹 **Options Pricing** – Implementing Black-Scholes & Monte Carlo simulations ⏳  

📌 **These will be stored in `trading-systems/` with proper documentation.**
