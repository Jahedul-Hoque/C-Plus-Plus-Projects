## 📖 **Introduction to C++ (Learning Path)**  

This section documents my structured **C++ learning path**, inspired by courses like Coursera.  

### ✅ Topics Covered:  

1️⃣ **Union-Find & Quick-Union** (Disjoint Sets)  
2️⃣ **Mathematical Models & Complexity** (Big-O Notation)  
3️⃣ **Stacks, Queues & Iterators**  
4️⃣ **Sorting Algorithms** (Selection, Insertion, Merge, QuickSort)  
5️⃣ **Binary Heaps & Priority Queues**  
6️⃣ **Symbol Tables (BSTs, Hash Tables, Red-Black Trees)**  
7️⃣ **Geometric Algorithms (Convex Hull, KD-Trees)**  

📌 **Each topic has its own subfolder in `intro-to-cpp/` with code implementations.**

## 💰 **Financial & Trading Systems (Advanced Projects)**  

Here, I apply C++ to build **financial models**, optimize **market data processing**, and experiment with **low-latency trading strategies**.  

### ✅ Planned Projects:  

🔹 **Market Data Handler** – Parsing real-time stock market feeds  
🔹 **Order Execution Engine** – Simulating trade execution with low-latency techniques  
🔹 **Backtesting System** – Running historical simulations for trading strategies  
🔹 **Options Pricing** – Implementing Black-Scholes & Monte Carlo simulations  

📌 **These will be stored in `trading-systems/` with proper documentation.**
