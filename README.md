  <b>Documenting my journey learning C++ as an End User Service Engineer at a HedgeFund</b>
</p>

## **📌 Overview**
This repository showcases **C++ projects** focused on **financial data analysis, market data processing, and trade analytics**.  Each project includes hands-on tasks such as **programming with low latency and financial computations**, which are crucial skills for C++ developers in trading firms, hedge funds, and banks.

### ✅ General Topics Covered:  

1️⃣ **Pointers and References**   

2️⃣ **Functions and Declarations**  

3️⃣ **Recursions**  

4️⃣ **Classes and Objects** 

5️⃣ **Inheritance and Polymorphism**  

6️⃣ **Operator Overloading**  

7️⃣ **Memory Management**  

8️⃣ **Row-Major vs Collumn Major** 

9️⃣ **Testing L1 L2 L3 Cache Latency** 



### ✅ Planned DSA Topics Covered:  

1️⃣ **Linked Lists** 

2️⃣ **Doubly Linked Lists**  

3️⃣ **Hash Tables**

4️⃣ **Sorting Algorithms**   

5️⃣ **Vectors**  

6️⃣ **Symbol Tables**  

7️⃣ **Trees**  

📌 **Each topic has its own subfolder in `intro-to-cpp/` with code implementations and READMEs.**

## 💰 **Financial & Trading Systems (Advanced Projects)**  

Here, I apply C++ to build **financial models**, optimize **market data processing**, and experiment with **low-latency trading strategies**.  

### ✅ Planned Projects:  

🔹 **Order Execution Engine** – Simulating trade execution with low-latency techniques 
 
🔹 **Backtesting System** – Running historical simulations for trading strategies  

🔹 **Options Pricing** – Implementing Black-Scholes & Monte Carlo simulations  

📌 **These will be stored in `trading-systems/` with proper documentation.**
