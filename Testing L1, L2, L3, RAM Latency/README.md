# 📌 Cache & RAM Latency Test

## 📖 Overview
This program measures the latency of various memory hierarchies, including L1, L2, L3 caches, and RAM. By performing memory access tests with different data sizes, it helps to visualize how access times change as data moves from the processor's caches to system RAM. This is useful for understanding performance bottlenecks and optimizing software for low-latency operations.

The program runs on different data sizes that fit within specific cache levels and RAM to demonstrate the varying access times. It uses a **stride access pattern** to bypass CPU prefetching, allowing us to measure cache miss latency.

## 📌 Key Concepts
- **L1 Cache**: The first level of cache located closest to the CPU core. It has the lowest latency and stores frequently accessed data.
- **L2 Cache**: A larger, slower cache located between the CPU and RAM. It acts as a buffer between the fast L1 cache and slower RAM.
- **L3 Cache**: The largest and slowest cache, shared by multiple CPU cores, located further from the CPU.
- **RAM**: The system's main memory, much slower than cache but with much larger capacity.
- **Cache Miss**: When the CPU needs to access data from a lower-level cache or RAM because it was not found in the higher-level cache.

## 💻 Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>

using namespace std;

// Function to measure memory access time
double measure_latency(size_t vector_size) {
    vector<int> vec(vector_size, 1); // Allocate an vector of given size
    volatile int sum = 0; // Prevent compiler optimization

    auto start = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    // starts the timer
    for (size_t i = 0; i < vector_size; i += 16) {
        sum += vec[i];
        // Access memory with a large stride to avoid prefetching
    }

    auto end = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    chrono::duration<double> elapsed = end - start;

    return elapsed.count();
    // stops timer and gives timer count
}

int main() {
    cout << "Cache & RAM Latency Test (Lower is Faster)
";
    cout << "-------------------------------------------
";

    size_t sizes[] = {
        8 * 1024,   // 8 KB  (Fits in L1)
        32 * 1024,  // 32 KB (L1 size)
        256 * 1024, // 256 KB (Fits in L2)
        2 * 1024 * 1024,  // 2 MB (Fits in L3)
        16 * 1024 * 1024, // 16 MB (Beyond L3, RAM access starts)
        128 * 1024 * 1024 // 128 MB (Definitely in RAM)
    };

    for (size_t size : sizes) {
        double time_taken = measure_latency(size / sizeof(int));
        // time taken is equal to 
        cout << "Vector Size: " << size / 1024 << " KB -> Time: " << time_taken << " seconds
";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## 🔍 Explanation
1. **Memory Access Time Measurement**
   - A vector of integers is allocated with a given size.
   - A `volatile` variable is used to prevent the compiler from optimizing out the memory access loop.
   - The `measure_latency` function measures the time taken to access memory in strides of 16 bytes, which helps simulate cache misses by reducing CPU prefetching.

2. **Cache & RAM Size Breakdown**
   - The program tests several data sizes: 8 KB, 32 KB, 256 KB, 2 MB, 16 MB, and 128 MB, which correspond to various cache levels (L1, L2, L3) and system RAM.
   - The access times for each data size are printed in seconds, with smaller values indicating faster access.

## 🚀 Results
The output provides latency measurements for different memory access sizes:

- **L1 Cache (8 KB)**: Extremely low latency, measured in microseconds.
- **L2 Cache (256 KB)**: Slightly higher latency than L1 but still faster than RAM.
- **L3 Cache (2 MB)**: Latency increases significantly as the data size moves beyond the L2 cache but still stays faster than RAM.
- **RAM (128 MB)**: Demonstrates the highest latency as the program accesses data outside the processor's cache hierarchy.

## 💡 Advantages of Cache Latency Testing
✅ Helps visualize the performance bottlenecks related to memory access.  
✅ Useful for optimizing memory access patterns in performance-critical applications.  
✅ Understanding cache behavior can improve software efficiency, especially for high-performance computing.

## ⚠️ Potential Pitfalls
❌ Cache access patterns can vary significantly across different hardware.  
❌ Latency may be affected by other system factors, such as CPU load and memory contention.  
❌ The stride access pattern may not fully capture other types of memory access (sequential vs random access).

## 🛠️ Performance Optimization
- Minimize cache misses by optimizing data locality.
- Ensure data fits within the cache sizes (especially L1 and L2) for faster access.
- Consider using optimized memory allocation patterns for large data sets.

🎯 **Best Practice**: Always measure and understand the latency associated with your application’s memory access, and use that data to guide optimization decisions!
